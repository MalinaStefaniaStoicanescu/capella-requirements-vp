		<p>As specified in the previous section, after a Reqif import a new
			file .bridgetraces is created aside the .capella file which is used
			for successive imports. Models that have been created in previous
			versions of Capella need to be migrated for this version, including
			the .bridgetraces file.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>If the .bridgetraces file is present in your Capella project, it will be automatically migrated during the migration procedure. For more details regarding the migration please of Capella projects please consult <b>Capella Guide / User Manual / First steps with Capella / How to Migrate Capella Project</b></li>
